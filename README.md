# classification experiments

## car detection using magnetic field

- vehicle type detection using single three axis magtic field sensor
- time series CNN (1D convs) were used

## line detection from camera

- for line follower or first self-driving cars experiments
- include templated embedded C++ only inference - running in 8bit precission
